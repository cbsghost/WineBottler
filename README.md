WineBottler packages Windows-based programs like browsers, media-players, games or business appli­ca­tions snugly into Mac app-bundles. WineBottler runs your Windows-based programs directly on your Mac. This is possible thanks to a Windows-compatible subsystem, which is provided by the great OpenSource tool Wine.
