Wine.app is a bundle for Wine. Our target is to offer Wine in a flavor, that makes it easy to use on OS X.

		<h1>Wine</h1>
Wine lets you run Windows software on other operating systems. With Wine, you can install and run these applications just like you would in Windows.<br>
Wine is still under active development. Not every program works yet, however there are already several million people using Wine to run their software.

		<h2>Open Source and User Driven</h2>
Wine will always be free software. Approximately half of Wine's source code is written by volunteers. The rest is sponsored by commercial interests, especially Codeweavers who sell a supported version of Wine.<br>
Wine is heavily reliant on its user community. User tests fill our Application Database to track how well programs work, and all the answers in the forums come from volunteers.<br>
